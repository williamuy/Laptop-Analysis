## Web Scraping Process 
The data was sourced from Best Buy, chosen for its comprehensive and up-to-date laptop listings. Python scripts utilizing libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Selenium were employed for scraping, ensuring efficient and accurate data extraction.

To view the web scraper, you can find it in the [web scraping notebook](notebooks/Best%20Buy%20Web%20Scraper.ipynb).

## Data Cleaning Methodology
The cleaning process involved removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats. Special attention was given to transforming categorical variables and normalizing numerical data for meaningful analysis.

To view the data preprocessing, you can find it in the [data cleaning notebook](NoteBooks/Data_Cleaning.ipynb).

## Data Visualization Overview
A variety of visualizations were created, including histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to explore different aspects of the data. These visualizations focus on price distribution, brand and operating system analysis, and uncovering potential correlations.

To view the full data visualization, you can find it in the [data viz notebook](NoteBooks/Data_Viz.ipynb).
